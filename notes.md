# My notes
Git:
git status just shows if there any untracked files or unstaged changes<br>
git log shows commit history<br>
git checkout . just restores your working directory to the last commit. So if no changes have been made then nothing will happen.<br>
git checkout (7 digits of id) notes.md will just revert the notes file and you can update and push that. But git checkout id will revert the whole directory<br>
MARKDOWN: If you want to do a new line, just do >> instead of > and include '<br>'
git commit -am will add and commit the file at the same time<br>
